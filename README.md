# Calibration-Management-System
To accomplish this project, I used a software called Xampp.

  XAMPP is a software package that includes a collection of tools used for building and testing websites on a local computer. It's essentially a "tool" for creating a local web server environment. 
  
**Here's why XAMPP is considered a tool:**
  
  **Bundled Components:**
  
XAMPP includes essential components like Apache (web server), MySQL (database), PHP, and Perl, which are all tools used in web development. 

  **Local Development:** 
  
It allows developers to set up a local server on their computers to test websites and applications before deploying them to a live server. 

  **Ease of Use:**
  
XAMPP is designed to be user-friendly and simplify the process of setting up a local development environment, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers. 

    **Testing and Prototyping:**

XAMPP is a valuable tool for testing website functionality, debugging code, and prototyping web applications locally. 

  **Open Source:**

It's an open-source tool, meaning it's free to use and modify. 

  **Multiple Operating Systems:**

XAMPP is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile tool for different development environments. 
In essence, XAMPP provides a suite of tools that work together to create a comprehensive local development environment for web projects.

**"The calibration is caliculated in the CALIBRATION DETAILS, which is our required output"**



**Note:**
In the Xampp control, change the port numbers of apache according to your system, and also mysql port to 3307 from 3306.



Store the codes as follows:

**Xampp file** --> **htdocs** --> **Create a project folder to store codes** --> **store the php codes in the folder**

  
  **store the index page in the htdocs folder**
